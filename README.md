## World DIS data tables
World __proton__ and __deuteron__ data of unploarized DIS cross sections, F2 structure functions, and the longitudinal to transverse cross section ratio R are collected or extracted from various experiments. Data were collected for the CJ global fit and related analysis. Now open for general use. See details under the __data__ directory.


## Neutron F2 extraction
Based on the collected F2 data, we performed a data-driven extraction of __neutron F2__ and __neutron-to-proton F2n/F2p ratio__ within the CJ15 framework (see eq. 7-9 in reference for details). Data from all experiemnts are cross-normalized and combined into a single Excel file, both in the original kineamtics, as well as rebinned in Q^2. Check the __f2n__ directory.
