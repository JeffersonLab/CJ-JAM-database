## Words on Uncertainties (from Osipenko):

Unfortunately there is no "overall normalization" part, however because CLAS is not very precise detector the dominant uncertainty is point-to-point correlated (due to wide acceptance and complex detector structure). The overall part is perhaps 1-3%, but we never separated it.
