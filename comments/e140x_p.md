# SLAC E140x Proton and Deuteron F2 Structure Function 

*calculated by using cross section from e140x_sp (e140x_sd) and R from e140x_rp (e140x_rd). 

## Reference:

L. Tao, Ph.D. Thesis, The American University, 1994

## Uncertainties:

dFST and dFSY: The point-to-point statistical and systematic uncertainties, same as in the cross section. Both are uncorrelated.

dFSZ: an additional uncertainty due to the uncertainty in R, correlated.

dFRC: uncertainty due to the radiative correction, correlated.

*See eq 5.38, 5.39 in L.Whitlow's thesis for details about dFSZ and dFRC.

*Below are F2 provided by Peter(calculated from f2allm.f?) . They are different from the presented calculation.(3% smaller). ??
Peter's results are likely from LT separation.Not use this for now, though it's more right
