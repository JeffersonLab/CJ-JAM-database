## Source: 
Measured hydrogen and deuterium per-nucleon cross section from table 16-18, p124-126 in reference. Converted to reduced cross section by P.Monaghan (summer '14, see e140x_p). Checked by Shujie Li (June,2017)

## Uncertainties:
norm_c : 1.732% = 2% (total normalization uncertainty from table 10, p100) - 1% (dRC_u), correlated
dRC: epsilon-dependent radiative correction uncertainty, correlated
dST and dSY: point-to-point statistical and systematic uncertainties, uncorrelated.
