## Reference: 

Ioana's thesis: https://misportal.jlab.org/ul/publications/view_pub.cfm?pub_id=5397

## Source files: 

h2_ioana_98_f2.txt and d2_ioana_98_f2.txt from Ioana's email.

## Uncertainty:
*stat_u:The source file listed only the statistical uncertainty. 

*The total systematic uncertainty is 3.1% from table 3.5, ref p107, among which 
	*norm_c: the beam energy, target density, and charge uncertainties are pulled out to get the normalization uncertainty = sqrt(0.3^2+0.7^2+1^2) = 1.26%. 
	*syst_u: the remained is denoted as uncorrelated systematic uncertainty = sqrt(3.1^2 - 1.26^2)=2.83%
