__Proton and deuteron F2 and reduced sigma from JLab Hall C E00-116 experiment__

* Log:
  * @aaccardi (Oct 2016) -- initial entry, converted from CJ database

* Source: CJ database 
  * tables reformatted from S.Malace e-mail, ca 2010
  * 'sig_r' and 'Y' columns created from original tables in paper by P.Monaghan, probably, ca 2013

* Ref:
  * F2 extraction in S.Malace, PhD thesis, Hampton University, December 2006.
  * Published paper (S.Malace et al. Phys.Rev.C80:035207,2009) has only cross
section

* Normalization error
  * 1.75%  (included in calculated __*norm_c__ column)
  
* Notes:
  * "deuteron" here means d/2, _i.e._, the per nucleon observable
    (the original tables from S.Malace give the full F2d)
