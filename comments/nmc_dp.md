# NMC deuteron to proton F2 ratio 
* actually cross section as delta_R =0 was assumed.

## Reference: doi 10.1016/S0550-3213(96)00673-6
## Source: table 3 in ref.

## Uncertainties:
dstat: absolute statistical error.

dsys : absolute systematic error which is VX, SM, RC, E, Ep summed in quadratual.

dVX  : vertex resolution error in %, fully correlated.

dSM  : kinematics resolution error in %, fully correlated.

dRC  : total radiative correction error in %, fully correlated.

dE   : incident muon momentum error in %, correlated within same beam energy.

dEp  : scattered muon momentum error in %, correlated within same beam energy.

* dE and dEp are treated as fully correlated since no info about beam energy is given
