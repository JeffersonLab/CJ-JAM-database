## Uncertainties:
norm:  a 0.25% normalization uncertainty is assumed to account for the 0.1% level target density uncertainty (sec3.3 in ref) and 0.15% internal normalization (sec5 in ref)

dstat: absolute statistical error.

dsys : absolute systematic error which is VX, SM, RC, E, Ep summed in quadratual.

dVX  : vertex resolution error in %, fully correlated.

dSM  : kinematics resolution error in %, fully correlated.

dRC  : total radiative correction error in %, fully correlated.

dE   : incident muon momentum error in %, correlated within same beam energy.

dEp  : scattered muon momentum error in %, correlated within same beam energy.

* dE and dEp are treated as fully correlated since no info about beam energy is given
