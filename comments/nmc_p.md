# NMC Proton and Deuteron F2
## Reference: 
hep-ph/9610231, table 3 and 4

* Note on R: 

  For x < 0.12, the target-averaged R in table 3 and 4 were extracted from NMC data as a function of x at an averaged Q2. -> runs in 1989
  
  For x >= 0.12, R1990 [ref: PRB 250 (1990) 193] was used -> runs from 1986-1989
  
  Error on R are NOT propagated to sig_r. Since the NMC didn't consider the R errors when getting F2 ??.


  ## Uncertainties:

        dE:    systematic uncertainty (%) from incident muon energy. Correlated between p and d targets, but independent between different energies.

        dE':   systematic uncertainty (%) from scattered muon energy.Correlated between p and d targets, but independent between different energies.

        dAC:   systematic uncertainty (%) from acceptance. Fully correlated for all energies and targets.

        dRC:   systematic uncertainty (%) from radiative correction. Correlated between all energies but independent for p and d targets.

        dRE:   systematic uncertainty from the reconstruction efficiency. Fully correlated for all energies and targets.

        dST:   statistical uncertainty (%). dST = dFstat/F2p * 100

        norm: 2.5% normalization uncertainty including relative normalization
