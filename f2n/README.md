### Note: GitHub does not provide a preview of xlsx files.  Please click on the file, then the __View raw__ button to download.

Results of the data-driven extraction of __neutron F2__ and __neutron-to-proton F2n/F2p ratio__ within the CJ15 framework (see eq. 7-9 in [arXiv:2309.16851](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16851) for details). Data from all experiemnts are cross-normalized and combined in a single Excel file, both in the original kineamtics, as well as rebinned in Q^2 as in the figures.

The neutron extraction necessitated of a careful cross-normalization and kinematic match of the world proton and Deuterron structure functions. Here we provide Excel tables with the cross-normalized F2p and F2d structure functions, both in the original experimental kinematics, and rebinned in Q^2.
